## Alternative Tweet Ideas (Ongoing)

- "432Hz is the natural frequency. Most apps tune to 440Hz. Neural Shift uses 432Hz. The difference matters."
- "I didn't build this to make money. I built it because I needed it. It works. Share it if you agree."
- "The best time to start was 30 days ago. The second best time is now."
- "Headphones required. Speakers won't work. This isn't Spotify - it's brainwave engineering."
- "21 programs. 0 ads. 1 mission: help you rewrite your frequency."
