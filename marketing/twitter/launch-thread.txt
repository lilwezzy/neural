**Tweet 1 (Lead):**
I rebuilt my brain for wealth using binaural beats + 15kHz silent affirmations

Built an app to do it properly

21 programs. 8D audio. Science-backed.

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
Most binaural beat apps are garbage:

❌ Low quality audio
❌ No subliminal layer
❌ Cookie-cutter frequencies
❌ Annoying ads

I wanted something better.

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
Neural Shift combines 3 technologies:

1. Binaural beats (Schumann resonance base)
2. 8D spatial audio (rotates around your head)
3. Silent subliminals at 15kHz (Bluetooth-optimized)

The 3rd one is the game-changer.

**Tweet 4 (Features):**
21 programs for every goal:

💰 Wealth (Money Magnet, Wealth Architect)
🧠 Memory (GENUS 40Hz)
💚 Healing (DNA REGEN, Vagus Reset)
⚡ Performance (The Zone, Peak Flow)
🗣️ Social (Executive Presence)
🌀 Transcendence (The Observer)

**Tweet 5 (How it works):**
The silent subliminal layer uses "Neural Pincer" technology:

🎯 Layer 1: Normal speed (conscious processing)
🎯 Layer 2: 2.1x speed (subconscious processing)

Your brain processes both, but you only hear the carrier tone.

It's wild. Try it with headphones.
