**Title:** Built my own neural entrainment app with silent 15kHz affirmations

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I've been experimenting with binaural beats for years and finally built my own app that combines everything I've learned about neural entrainment.

**What makes Neural Shift different:**

🎧 Binaural beats with Schumann resonance (7.83Hz base)  
🌐 8D spatial audio that rotates around your head  
🤫 Silent subliminals at 15kHz (Bluetooth-optimized)  
⚡ Neural Pincer - dual-layer affirmations at 1.0x and 2.1x speed for accelerated reprogramming  

**21 programs across 6 categories:**

💰 Wealth - Money Magnet, Wealth Architect, Wealth Singularity  
🧠 Memory - GENUS 40Hz (gamma wave optimization)  
💚 Healing - DNA REGEN, Vagus Reset, Elevated Emotions, Restore 1.0  
⚡ Performance - The Zone, Peak Flow, Dopamine Reset, Habit Breaker  
🗣️ Social - Executive Presence, Magnetic Voice, The Negotiator  
🌀 Transcendence - The Observer, Quantum Collapse

**Free to use:** 5 programs unlocked, 16 locked behind a one-time $97 lifetime upgrade (or $7.99/mo).

Been testing it for a month and the results have been wild. The Vagus Reset alone cured my chronic stress.

Would love feedback from people who actually know this space.
