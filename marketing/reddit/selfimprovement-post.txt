**Title:** I built an app to reprogram my subconscious mind (it actually works)

**Body:**

Long story short: I was stuck. Limiting beliefs. Poor focus. Chronic stress.

Tried everything:
- Meditation apps (boring)
- Therapy (expensive)
- Self-help books (informational but no impact)
- Subliminal videos on YouTube (low quality)

So I built my own solution.

**Neural Shift** uses three technologies to reprogram your subconscious:

1. **Binaural beats** - Synchronizes your brainwaves
2. **8D spatial audio** - Rotates sound around your head for immersion
3. **Silent subliminals** - 15kHz affirmations you can't consciously hear

The third one is the key. Your subconscious processes the affirmations even though your conscious mind doesn't hear them.

**21 programs:**
- Wealth mindset (Money Magnet, Wealth Architect)
- Memory (GENUS 40Hz - gamma waves)
- Healing (DNA REGEN, Vagus Reset)
- Performance (The Zone, Peak Flow)
- Social (Executive Presence, Magnetic Voice)
- Transcendence (The Observer)

**How I use it:**
- 30 min morning session with Money Magnet
- Vagus Reset before bed
- The Zone for deep work

Results after 30 days:
- Significantly less anxiety
- More abundant mindset
- Better focus during work

**Free to try:** https://neural-ashy.vercel.app/

5 programs unlocked, rest require upgrade (one-time $97 or $7.99/mo)

No ads. No bs. Just frequencies.

Would love to hear from others who experiment with neural entrainment.
